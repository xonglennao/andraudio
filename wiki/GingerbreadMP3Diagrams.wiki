#summary Sequence diagrams for MP3 playback on Gingerbread.

= Introduction =

These diagrams attempt to show what happens in a typical case where you play an MP3 stored locally on your device; from the (native) `MediaPlayer` class and all the way down to `AudioHardware`. There are 3 diagrams: one showing what happens when you do `MediaPlayer::setDataSource;` one for `MediaPlayer::prepare;` and one for `MediaPlayer::start`.



= Notes =

  * The diagrams are not 100% complete. If they were they'd be huge. And I considered some things to not be of enough interest to include.
  * The diagrams are only relevant for Gingerbread and (hopefully) later versions of Android (maybe Froyo as well.. I've never looked much at the Froyo code).
  * I've tried to double-check almost everything I put into the diagrams to make sure that they are correct, but I'm not ruling out the possibility that there might be some errors still in there.
  * The blue arrows in the diagrams represent calls to void methods (or method calls where the return value is ignored).
  * The red, teal and purple colors don't mean anything special. They were just added to make it a bit more clear where a related sequence of calls begins and ends.
