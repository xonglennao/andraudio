#summary A worksheet for hammering out Audio Plugin concepts

= Introduction =

This wiki page is a sloppy worksheet (work in progress) for hammering out the goals and intents of an Audio Plugin system for Android.  It is expected that this will be replaced by a more formalized set of wiki pages.

= Problem Statement =

A system on Android that allows host applications to be extended at runtime by utilizing executable code from 3rd party packages (apps) that are not known a priori.  The host application is in full control of the startup, execution, shutdown, and display of the 3rd party app.  This includes a system of discovering (at run time) the existence of available plugins.  The intent is for audio-specific plugins (PCM audio as well as MIDI and other event protocols). 

= Definitions =

host / host application - The main app that the user is using.  It is in control of all the plugins, session management, and execution.

plugin - A 3rd party app that conforms to the plugin protocol and is capable of being utilized by a host application.

= Prior Art =

Other systems that we can learn from include:
  * LV2, DSSI, and LADSPA
  * VST and VSTi
  * JACK
  * Rewire
  * ASIO
  * GMPI

Please also see NativePlugins which describes a possible solution for
direct packaging and discovery of native plugins.

= Features =

Required:
  * Zero copy buffers

Would be nice:
  * plugin sandboxing

Non-features:
  * Utilization of a 3rd party audio daemon (like jackd, pulseaudio, arts, etc)

= Brainstorming =

Please add your ideas here.
