===================
libaudio proxy test
===================

Requirements
------------

* android ndk r5

* a rooted Android device. An emulator should do too.

* android platform source code. This is the entire AOSP source code
  checked out with repo. Checking out individual git repositories 
  is also possible but not tested. 
  
Note that the platform source should match the version of Android running 
on your device. 

For instance, when building for Android 1.6, this can be used to switch
to the donut branch::

  repo init -u git://android.git.kernel.org/platform/manifest.git -b donut
  repo sync
    

Setup
-----

Copy Makefile.in to Makefile, and adjust the following variables:

- APP_PLATFORM: android target (android-3, android-4, etc..)
- ANDROID_SRC: path to the complete Android platform source 

Plug the Android device, and then run::

  make libs

This will pull some dynamic libraries from the device and put them
into system_libs/. This is needed to prevent undefined references
when linking.

Building and running the test
-----------------------------

To build, simply type::  

  make

Provided that a device is plugged, the test can be built and run with::

  make launch 

Although not strictly necessary, it may be useful to stop the android 
media server before lauching the test::

  stop media

By default, the test doesn't use dlopen. To load libaudio with dlopen, 
add ``DLOPEN=libaudio.so`` when using the ``launch`` rule.

To build for the msm7k target (Google Dev Phone 2, eg: HTC Magic 32B)
add the ``TARGET=msm7k`` variable (note: this shouldn't be necessary)

Add ``V=1`` for a verbose build, and ``-B`` to rebuild everything.
